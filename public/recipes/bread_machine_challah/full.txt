This bread machine challah recipe is absolutely delicious. I use a 2-pound bread machine to make the challah dough. It freezes well.

Ingredients:
1 cup warm water
½ cup white sugar
½ cup vegetable oil
2 large eggs, room temperature
1 tablespoon honey
2 ½ teaspoons salt
4 cups bread flour
2 ¼ teaspoons bread machine yeast

Egg Wash:
1 large egg
1 tablespoon water

Instructions:
1. Place warm water, sugar, oil, eggs, honey, salt, flour, and yeast into a bread machine in the order listed (or as recommended by the manufacturer). Select the Dough cycle and press Start.
2. When the cycle finishes, remove the dough from the machine and place on a lightly floured board. Punch down dough and let it rest for 5 minutes.
3. Grease a baking tray.
4. Divide dough in half, then divide each half into 3 ropes. Braid 3 ropes together to form each loaf. Place loaves onto the prepared baking tray. Mist with water, cover loosely with plastic wrap, and let rise until doubled, about 1 to 1 ½ hours.
5. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
6. Make egg wash by beating together egg and water.
7. Brush the tops and sides of loaves with egg wash.
8. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes. If loaves brown too quickly, loosely cover them with foil.
